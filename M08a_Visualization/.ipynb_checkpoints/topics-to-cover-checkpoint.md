## Resources
* [Topic modeling visualization â€“ How to present the results of LDA models?](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-visualization-how-to-present-results-lda-models/)
* [Visualizing Topic Models with Scatterpies and t-SNE](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-topic-models-with-scatterpies-and-t-sne-f21f228f7b02)

## Ideas to cover somewhere in the course
* Relationship between OHCO, labels, and DOC tables
  * OHCO levels come from selected a bag from the TOKEN table to generate the DOC table
  * Labels a propagated from the LIB table  
  * OHCO on the left (index), labels on the right of a DOC table
  * OHCO is structural
  * Labels are substantive (more or less)
